# UNet-dose-distribution

### Overview 

This project serves as the end-of-studies project within Data science & Data engineering program at the ENSAI - National School of Statistics and Data Analysis (www.ensai.fr), fulfilling the requirements for module validation in the final year. The goal of the project is improve the statistical quality of Monte Carlo dose distribution in radiotherapy using Deep learning. Our aim is to recover a high sampling dose distribution from a low sampling dose distribution leveraging models such as UNet and its variants (UNet++, AttentionUNet).
